I am a PhD candidate at the University of Granada, where I am working on my thesis under the supervision of [Siham Tabik](https://decsai.ugr.es/en/about/staff-directory/siham-tabik), and a Research Engineer at [Nemotec](https://nemostudio.nemotec.com/en/), where I develop and deploy deep learning models for medical imaging applications.

I really like to learn new things, in general, and machine learning things, in particular. My research focuses on adapting neural networks to the unique challenges of complex datasets. I am passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge deep learning research and real-world applications.

In my free time, I enjoy reading about economics, business, politics, and health. Thankfully, I also love strength training, football, and hiking with great friends.
